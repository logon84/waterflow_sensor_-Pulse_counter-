# Waterflow sensor - pulse counter which sends data over MQTT

* This counter uses interrupts on ESP-01's GPIO3.
* It is "talk-only" client. 
* It sends out data while pulses detected.
* It keeps adding pulses until poweroff/reset.

### MQTT Message consists of 
       pulses - Number of pulses counted since last device boot.
       moved_last_half_hour - "1" if rising or falling edges were detected on last half hour.
       last_pulse - Last falling pulse detected datetime.
       since - ESP8266 last boot date.
